## Intorduction
You may have suffered from adding hundreds components one by one before each deployment. It's an extremely boring stuff. It's very simple but takes time, so this task is very suitable for automation by programming. That's why I developed this simple tool.


## Download AOA
### [Download from Google Drive](https://goo.gl/PDyzNw)

## Before starting creating *outbound change set*
1. Check if the *AOA* folder contains
	* AOA.exe
	* AOAconfig.ini
	* chromedriver.exe
	* Component List.csv
2. Verify the URLs of *OutboundChangeSet* wrote in *AOAconfig.ini*  
	For now, the URL of STG is 
```https://trendmicro--stg.cs30.my.salesforce.com/changemgmt/listOutboundChangeSet.apexp?retURL=%2Fui%2Fsetup%2FSetup%3Fsetupid%3DDeploy&setupid=OutboundChangeSet```
URL of Beta is 
```https://trendmicro--beta.cs51.my.salesforce.com/changemgmt/listOutboundChangeSet.apexp?retURL=%2Fui%2Fsetup%2FSetup%3Fsetupid%3DDeploy&setupid=OutboundChangeSet```
But it might be changed after refresh.

3. Prepare the list of components
You can follow the format of the CSV file(Component List.csv)
Here is an example list:
| Component Type<br>(required) | API name<br>(required)	| Object<br>(if need) |
| ------------- | --------- | ---- |
|Page Layout|TS Contact Page Layout|Contact|
|Page Layout|TS Contact Page Layout w MSI|Contact|
|Static Resource|ideas||
|Static Resource|ideasRAW||
|Workflow Rule|TS Open Case Age > 30 Days||
|Workflow Email Alert|TS Open Case Age > 30 Day||
|Custom Field|AC_SN|Invoice Details|
|Custom Field|Co-Term|Invoice Details|
|Language Translation|Japanese||
